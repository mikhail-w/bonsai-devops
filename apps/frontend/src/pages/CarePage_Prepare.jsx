            To care for your bonsai tree, you'll need the right tools. Essential
            tools include sharp pruning shears, wire cutters, a root rake, and a
            watering can with a fine nozzle. These will allow you to prune,
            shape, and water your tree properly.

          <Text fontFamily="Lato" mt="4" mb="4">
            Bonsai trees require well-draining soil to prevent root rot. A
            typical bonsai soil mix consists of akadama, pumice, and lava rock.
            This blend ensures that your treeâ€™s roots get plenty of oxygen while
            retaining enough moisture for healthy growth. Make sure to choose a
            soil mix suited to your bonsai species.

          <Text fontFamily="Lato" mt="4" mb="4">
            Bonsai trees are confined to small pots, so they require regular
            fertilization to receive adequate nutrients. Choose a balanced
            fertilizer with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and apply it
            during the growing season. Be sure to follow the instructions
            carefully to avoid over-fertilization.

          <Text fontFamily="Lato" mt="4" mb="4">
            Repotting your bonsai tree every 2-3 years ensures healthy root
            growth and prevents the tree from becoming root-bound. Carefully
            remove the tree from its pot, prune the roots, and place it in fresh
            bonsai soil. Make sure to anchor the tree securely in its pot to
            allow proper growth.
